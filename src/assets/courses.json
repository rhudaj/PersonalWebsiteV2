    "Data-Intensive Distributed Computing",
    "Introduces students to infrastructure for data-intensive computing, with a focus on abstractions, frameworks, and algorithms that allow developers to distribute computations across many machines.  Topics include core concepts (partitioning, replication, locality, consistency), computational models (MapReduce, dataflows, stream processing, bulk-synchronous parallel), and applications."

    "Introduction to Machine Learning",
    "Introduction to modeling and algorithmic techniques for machines to learn concepts from data. Generalization: underfitting, overfitting, cross-validation. Tasks: classification, regression, clustering. Optimization-based learning: loss minimization. regularization. Statistical learning: maximum likelihood, Bayesian learning. Algorithms: nearest neighbour, (generalized) linear regression, mixtures of Gaussians, Gaussian processes, kernel methods, support vector machines, deep learning, sequence learning, ensemble techniques. Large scale learning: distributed learning and stream learning. Applications: Natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, human computer interaction, information retrieval."

    "Database Management",
    "The main objective of this course is to introduce students to fundamentals of database technology by studying databases from three viewpoints: those of the database user, the database designer, and the database administrator. It teaches the use of a database management system (DBMS) by treating it as a black box, focusing only on its functionality and its interfaces. Topics include introduction to database systems, relational database systems, database design methodology, SQL and interfaces, database application development, concept of transactions, ODBC, JDBC, database tuning, database administration, and current topics (distributed databases, data warehouses, data mining)."
